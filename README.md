# Extend React Challenge

This is bare-bones version of one of our client apps, where we ask candidates to build out a small application. The goal: give both the candidate and the Extend team a chance to interact on a realistic, but limited (shooting for just a few hours), task. We see this as a two-way evaluation, for the team and the candidate to decide if its a good fit.

### Setup
Copy this repository to your own private repository on GitHub
```
git clone https://github.com/helloextend/react-challenge.git
cd react-challenge
yarn
yarn start
 ```
 You should now have the app running on http://localhost:8080

## Challenge
- Review the mock up available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/GsigoCnExV2jjTBanMZwFr/Dog-Breeds) (you will need to sign up for a free figma account to be able to inspect all the elements for paddings/margins etc)

- Review the [Dog.ceo api `By Breed` endpoint documentation](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed)

- The goal of this challenge is to be able to search for a breed of dogs in a search input and then display up to 10 images of that breed of dog on screen

- You should be able to favorite and unfavorite images of dogs, moving them into and out of the favorites section of the page

- Submit a PR in your repository, with a descriptive message, and no more than a few commits (each with a clear purpose)

- In your private repository, add `funador` as a collaborator, and send an email to `jesse@extend.com` with a link to your repository

- Before the next interview, we will provide PR feedback, to give you a chance to improve your solution before the call

- Feel free to ask questions, as we want to simulate working with the team

## Tips
- Be sure to add accurate typings! 

- Add some tests to verify that your components are working properly
